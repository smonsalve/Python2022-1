that simulates a game of Bingo for a single card. 

Begin by generating a list of all of the valid Bingo calls (B1 through O75).

B I N G O 
1 16
2 17 
3
4
5



Once the list has been created you can randomize the order of its elements 
by calling the shuffle function in the random module.

Then your program should consume calls out of the list,
 crossing out numbers on the card,
  until the card contains a crossed out line (horizontal, vertical or diagonal).
  
Simulate 1,000 games and report the minimum, maximum and average number of calls
 that must be made before the card wins.
