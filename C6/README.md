Dictionaries are another data structure that Python programmers can use to manage larger amounts of data.
While many of the exercises in this chapter can be solved with lists or if statements,
most (or even all) of them have solutions that are well suited to dictionaries. 

As a result, you should use dictionaries to solve all of these exercises instead of (or in addition to) using the constructs that you have been introduced to in the previous chapters. Completing the exercises in this chapter will help you learn to:

• Create a new variable that holds a dictionary
• Add a key-value pair to a dictionary
• Update the value associated with a key in a dictionary 
• Iterate over all of the keys and/or values in a dictionary 
• Write functions that take dictionaries as parameters
